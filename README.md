# Odin Project Landing Page

#Overview 
###This is a landing page where I am applying my skills after learning flex box for the first time! I was given a design to follow and was alllowed to change the colors and images of the site. I had to make this site completely from scratch as well. I wanted to try my best to replicate the page while adding my own personal touch. This is the page I was given to replicate :[https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png] .
I am still not as comfortable with flexbox since its still new to me, but this project helped me with getting the basics mastered. The following languages in this site were HTML and CSS. I utilized VSCODE (Visual Studio Code) to do my coding, since it is my favorite editor I have grown accustomed to using. The syntax highlighting and auto-completion in the text editor is very beneficial and helps me code better. I had alot of fun making this page and I love how it came out. At times while I was stuck I realized I just needed to take a step back and approach it in a different outlook. For anyone out there don't forget to take small breaks while you are coding and remember theres always many ways to do something. An important note is if you can make your code shorter or more simpler and join classes do that! I am still working on it, but looking back at how far I have come you can only get better with coding more!
